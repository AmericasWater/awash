    "Several utilities and facilities operate accros multiple counties. For instance, New York City water supply system source its water from the Catskill Mountains and the Delaware river in Delaware County and distribute the water to all of the boroughs.\n",

    "Utilities of this type are not rare and occur at many locations across CONTUS. So that the water network allows to link the point of source and the point of use, additionnal connections have been added to the countydraws file. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cross-county utilities\n",
    "The first step consists in finding the utilities and facilities that operate across multiple counties. This is done by finding all of the water utilities operating within a given county on the Drinking Water Mapping Application to Protect Source Waters website (https://dwmapspublic.rti.org/). The website then redirects to the Safe Drinking Water Information System (SDWIS) Federal Reporting Services, which provides the list of counties served by the given water system (such as https://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/sfdw/f?p=SDWIS_FED_REPORTS_PUBLIC:PWS_SEARCH:::::PWSID:NY7003493). This led to the construction of a dataset canals.txt with the first column being the source county (referred by FIPS), and the other ones listing the counties the water facilities present in the source county serve. \n",

    "##### Add missing canals to the water network\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Current status\n",
    "As the number of water utilities is consequent, this task has not been accomplished for all counties yet. As a starting point, we focused our research on problematic areas: counties that presented a suspicious public supply withdrawals/population ratio, and counties with important population. The following plot (fig 1.a) shows the USGS 2010 public supply fresh water withdrawals in function of the population. The dots in green are the counties that have been added to the missing canals set. \n",

The new estimated demand is illustrated in fig 1.b in function of population and a comparison for the treated counties between demands and withdrawals can be found in fig 1.c.\n",
